    " ## Finding outliers using IQR\n",
    "Outliers can have big effects on statistics like mean, as well as statistics that rely on the mean, such as variance and standard deviation. Interquartile range, or IQR, is another way of measuring spread that's less influenced by outliers. IQR is also often used to find outliers. If a value is less than \n",
    " or greater than \n",
    ", it's considered an outlier. In fact, this is how the lengths of the whiskers in a matplotlib box plot are calculated."
